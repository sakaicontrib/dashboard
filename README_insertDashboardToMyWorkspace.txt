'When rolling out Dashboard tool, we need to make it the first tool in  MyWorksapce sites. 

For new users, their MyWorkspace sites will be creatd based on the !user.template.<user_type>, where we will put the Dashboard tool as the first tool in the site template.

For those existing MyWorkspace sites, use the updateMyWorkspaceSites.pl file to insert the Dashboard tool. Just replace the id, password (need to be admin user) and server urls.

People have been asking for the dashboard tool for a long time.  It was finally implemented thanks to the efforts of participants in a graduate course in the School of Information at The University of Michigan in Winter term 2011. 

The course, "Open Source Software Development", was organized by Chuck Severance and included contributions from people at various institutions that use Sakai, especially Charles Hedrick of Rutgers.  

The students primarily responsible for defining requirements and developing the initial design for the dashboard were Caitlin Holman and Nikola Collins.
